          A framework to kickstart your Jekyll sites with Bootstrap.

          Ursus is a framework built on a system of other libraries. The goal is to create a core template to help launch Jekyll sites faster with a streamlined file structure, data files to help organize third party libraries, and pre-determined layouts and features to help build at scale. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With a familiar folder structure and file set up it's easier to transition from WordPress (or any other CMS) to Jekyll and build sites as needed without convoluted, expansive, and unnecessary complex CMSs or databases.
